# bran-survival-analysis
The purpose of this repository is to once and for all complete a research project in network science that began in the summer of 2021. The intended audience consists of two groups: 
  1) Potential employers who want to see statistics and programming skills demonstrated in data science, and
  2) Mathematicians (especially my former collaborators) who want to understand and replicate my analysis.
 
Skills that will ultimately be showcased in this project are:
  1) Experience with Python libraries used in data science, namely numpy and scikit.learn,
  2) A foundational understanding of network science and the techniques of this field, including simulation,
  3) Experience with survival analysis,
  4) Research skills.
  
The goal is to understand how network structure influence the survival time of messages injected into a network under the influence of a certain interacting particle system. I will consider this respoitory presentable once I have built out the simulations to answer this question, and I will consider it complete when I have written an article on this topic and submitted it for publication.
