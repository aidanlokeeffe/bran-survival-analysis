I have had to take a detour in this project because I realized that I've allowed my mentor 
for this project to fall out of the loop. So I need to spend some time writing a note that
will update her as to what I've been doing. Along the way, I may produce some insights that 
will be of use in the project's current iteration, in which case I will also include those 
works here to serve as progress markers.
