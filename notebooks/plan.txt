I want to have a notebook that extracts network features from the small networks and 
write them to a file. Two sets of features, global and local features. Each type of feature
will have its own file. They need to be in the same order as the small networks.

Then, I want a notebook that carries out the simulations to produce the survival data. This 
should conform to your current iteration of the alphabet, your considerations about avoiding
message competition, etc.

Finally, I want a notebook that carries out the survival analysis.
